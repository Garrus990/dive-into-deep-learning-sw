    "Real data often contains a mix of different data types and needs to be preprocessed.\n",
    "Rescaling real-valued data to zero mean and unit variance is a good default. So is replacing missing values with their mean.\n",

    "1. Improve the score by improving the model (e.g., layers, weight decay, and dropout).\n",
